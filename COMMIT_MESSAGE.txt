feat: make all keybinds configurable and improve documentation

## Changes

### All Keybinds Now Configurable
- Made image preview keybind ('i') configurable instead of hardcoded
- Added `image_preview` field to Keybinds struct with default "i"
- Updated main.rs to check keybind config instead of hardcoding KeyCode::Char('i')
- All keybinds now have defaults but can be customized via config

### Keybinds Documentation (keybinds.toml)
- Rewrote keybinds.toml with comprehensive documentation
- Added clear descriptions for all keybinds (navigation, actions, cclip mode)
- Documented mouse support features (click, hover, scroll)
- Added complete key reference with syntax examples
- Documented image_preview keybind for cclip mode
- Better organized sections with clear headers

### Man Page Installation
- Updated flake.nix to install man page via postInstall hook
- Updated install.sh to copy man page to ~/.local/share/man/man1/
- Added mandb update in install.sh (if available)
- Both curl install and nix flake now support `man fsel`

### All Configurable Keybinds
- Navigation: up, down, left, right
- Actions: select, exit, pin, backspace
- Cclip mode: image_preview (fullscreen image display)
- All have sensible defaults but can be customized
- Mouse support: Click to launch, hover to highlight, scroll to navigate

No keybinds are hardcoded - everything is configurable with defaults.
