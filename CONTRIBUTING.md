## How to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to fsel:

### Code Contributions

- Fix bugs listed in [issues](https://github.com/Mjoyufull/fsel/issues)
- Implement new features
- Improve performance
- Refactor code for clarity or maintainability

### Non-Code Contributions

- Improve documentation (see [Documentation Changes](#documentation-changes) below)
- Create example configurations
- Answer questions in [discussions](https://github.com/Mjoyufull/fsel/discussions)
- Test new releases and report issues
- Package fsel for other distributions
- Write tutorials or blog posts

### Documentation Changes

**Simple documentation fixes** (typos, grammar, formatting) can be pushed directly to `main` without going through the PR process:

**Criteria for direct push:**
- Changes only to `.md` files (README, USAGE, CONTRIBUTING, etc.)
- No code changes whatsoever
- Typo fixes, grammar corrections, formatting improvements

**Process:**
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
# Make documentation changes
git commit -m "docs: fix typo in README"
git push origin main
# Sync to dev
git checkout dev
git merge main
git push origin dev
```

**For substantial documentation changes** (rewrites, new sections, structural changes), please use the normal PR process for review.

---

## Branching Strategy

**IMPORTANT**: Never push directly to `main` or `dev`. All changes go through pull requests.

### Primary Branches

| Branch | Purpose | Push Policy |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **main** | Stable, production-ready code. Every commit is a tagged release. | Never push directly. Merge only from `dev` after testing and tagging. |
| **dev** | Integration branch. All features merge here before `main`. | Never push directly. Only receives merges from feature branches via pull requests. |

### Feature Branches

All work occurs in feature branches created from `dev`:

| Type | Naming | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| Feature | `feat/name` | New features or functionality |
| Fix | `fix/name` | Bug fixes |
| Refactor | `refactor/name` | Code restructuring without changing behavior |
| Docs | `docs/name` | Documentation changes |
| Chore | `chore/name` | Tooling, dependencies, build updates |

### Standard Workflow

```sh
# 1. Create feature branch from dev
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name

# 2. Develop locally (commit freely)
git commit -am "wip: working on feature"

# 3. Prepare for PR (clean up commits)
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/dev
git rebase -i origin/dev  # Interactive rebase to clean history

# 4. Push feature branch
git push origin feat/your-feature-name

# 5. Open pull request targeting dev
```

---

## Commit Standards

Follow **Conventional Commits** format:

```
type(optional-scope): short description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Commit Types

| Type | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `chore` | Build, deps, tooling |
| `test` | Testing only |
| `style` | Whitespace, formatting |
| `revert` | Undo a commit |

### Examples

```sh
feat(detach): implement --detach flag with systemd-run support
fix(db): enforce foreign key constraints properly
refactor(cache): move batch operations to separate module
docs(usage): add examples for dmenu mode
chore: update flake.nix to use naersk
```

### During Development

- Commit as you work â€” don't obsess over perfection
- "wip" and "temp fix" are valid local commits
- Clean up commit history before opening PR using `git rebase -i`

---

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Rebase on latest dev**:
   ```sh
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/dev
   ```

2. **Run all checks**:
   ```sh
   cargo fmt
   cargo clippy -- -D warnings
   cargo test
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. **Clean commit history**:
   ```sh
   git rebase -i origin/dev
   ```

4. **Push branch**:
   ```sh
   git push origin feat/your-feature-name
   ```

### Opening a PR

1. Go to GitHub and open a pull request
2. **Base**: `dev` (NOT `main`)
3. **Compare**: your feature branch
4. Use the PR template below

### PR Template

**Title**: `feat: add your feature` (follow conventional commits)

**Body**:
```markdown
## Summary

### Draft Pull Requests

GitHub allows you to open PRs as "drafts" - these are PRs that aren't ready for review yet but you want to show your progress.

**When to use draft PRs:**
- You want early feedback on approach before completing the work
- You're working on a large feature and want visibility into your progress
- You want architectural review before full implementation
- You're stuck and need help to continue

**How to create a draft PR:**
1. When opening a PR on GitHub, click the dropdown on "Create pull request"
2. Select "Create draft pull request" instead
3. The PR will be marked as draft and reviewers won't be notified
4. When ready, click "Ready for review" to convert it to a normal PR

**Note:** Draft PRs still target the `dev` branch and follow all other PR guidelines.

### PR Guidelines

- Target the `dev` branch, not `main`
- Use a clear, descriptive title following conventional commits format
- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix
- Break large changes into smaller, reviewable PRs
- Respond to review feedback promptly
- Be open to suggestions and constructive criticism

---

## Code Review

### What to Expect

- **Initial response**: A few hours to a few days
- **Full review**: Within 1 week
- **Merge after approval**: Within 1-2 days
- Reviewers may request changes or ask questions
- Multiple rounds of review may be necessary

### Internal Merging

Sometimes PRs are accepted but merged internally as part of larger refactoring efforts:

- You will be credited in commit messages and release notes
- The functionality you contributed will be included
- This is not a rejection, but integration into ongoing development

Example maintainer response:
> "Thank you for this contribution. Your approach is better than the current implementation. I'm currently refactoring the project structure, so I'll be merging this internally as part of that effort. You'll be credited in the commit message and release notes when it ships."

### Stale PRs

- PRs without activity for **30 days** will be marked stale
- Stale PRs will be closed after **14 additional days** of inactivity
- Exception: PRs marked as work-in-progress or on-hold by maintainers
- Closed PRs can be reopened if work resumes

### Review Criteria

| Aspect | Expectation |
|--------|-------------|
| Correctness | The code does what it claims |
| Clarity | Another dev can understand it |
| Impact | Doesn't introduce regressions |
| Security | No obvious vulnerabilities |
| Style | Matches existing conventions |
| Documentation | Updated if needed |

### Feedback Etiquette

- Comment with **why**, not just "change this"
- Nitpicks = non-blocking
- If it's broken, mark **Request Changes**
- Prefer questions over commands:
  > "Could this be simplified?" not "Simplify this."

## Testing

### Running Tests

```sh
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run specific test
cargo test test_name

# Run tests with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run tests with backtrace
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo test
```

### Writing Tests

Add unit tests in the same file as the code:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_parse_desktop_entry() {
        let entry = parse_entry("test.desktop");
        assert!(entry.is_ok());
    }
}
```

Add integration tests in `tests/` directory for end-to-end testing.

### Manual Testing

Before submitting a pull request, manually test:

1. Basic application launching
2. Dmenu mode with piped input
3. Clipboard mode if cclip is installed
4. Mouse and keyboard navigation
5. Various command-line flags
6. Configuration file loading

---

## Coding Standards

### Rust Style

- Follow the official [Rust Style Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/style-guide/)
- Use `rustfmt` for formatting:
  ```sh
  cargo fmt
  ```
- Use `clippy` for linting:
  ```sh
  cargo clippy -- -D warnings
  ```
- All code must compile without warnings on Rust stable

### Code Quality

- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Add doc comments for public APIs:
  ```rust
  /// Launches an application with the specified detachment mode.
  ///
  /// # Arguments
  ///
  /// * `app` - The desktop application to launch
  /// * `detach` - Whether to detach the process
  ///
  /// # Returns
  ///
  /// Returns `Ok(())` on success, or an error if launching fails
  pub fn launch_app(app: &App, detach: bool) -> Result<()> {
      // implementation
  }
  ```
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Avoid deeply nested code
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Error Handling

- Use `Result` and `?` operator for error propagation
- Provide context with error messages:
  ```rust
  .with_context(|| format!("Failed to read config file: {}", path.display()))?
  ```
- Handle errors gracefully and provide user-friendly messages

### Performance Considerations

- Avoid unnecessary allocations
- Use references where possible
- Profile before optimizing
- Document performance-critical sections

## Suggesting Features

Feature suggestions are welcome. Before suggesting a feature:

1. Check if it has already been suggested in [issues](https://github.com/Mjoyufull/fsel/issues)
2. Consider if it fits fsel's scope as a TUI application launcher
3. Think about how it would be implemented

**Alternatives Considered**
Other ways you've considered solving this problem.

**Additional Context**
Any other context, mockups, or examples.
```

---

## Release Process

**Note**: Only maintainers handle releases and all version updates. Contributors do not need to update version numbers.

### Preparation (Maintainers Only)

1. Ensure all feature PRs are merged into `dev`
2. Confirm all tests pass:
   ```sh
   cargo test
   cargo build --release
   ```
3. Maintainers update version references in:
   - `Cargo.toml` (root directory)
   - `flake.nix` (root directory)
   - `README.md` (installation instructions)
   - Man pages (`fsel.1` or similar)
4. Prepare release notes following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)
5. Verify [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) compliance

### Codename Policy

**Codenames change only on MAJOR version bumps:**
- Codename for 2.x.x series: `seedclay`
- Previous codename for 1.x.x series: `riceknife`
- When 3.0.0 is released, a new codename will be chosen
- **Only maintainers** choose and assign codenames

This is a new policy starting from version 2.0.0. All 2.x.x releases use `seedclay`.

### Process

```sh
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge dev
git tag -a v2.2.0-seedclay -m "v2.2.0-seedclay: tag system and codebase refactor"
git push origin main --tags
```

### GitHub Release

Create a release using [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format:

```markdown
## [2.2.0-seedclay] - 2025-10-27

### Added
- Tag system for clipboard items with color/emoji metadata
- Sixel image support for Foot terminal

### Changed
- Major codebase refactor into modular structure
- Improved image clearing logic for Foot terminal

### Fixed
- Text disappearing after image display in Foot
- Tag metadata not persisting across sessions

### Notes
MINOR version bump per Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 - backward compatible.
```

---

## What Not To Do

### Absolutely Forbidden

- Push directly to `main` or `dev`
- Merge without PR
- Release without testing
- Ignore version updates in relevant files
- Skip running `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` before pushing

### Strongly Discouraged

- Inconsistent versioning
- Unreviewed breaking changes
- Merging with failing tests
- Ignoring clippy warnings
- Leaving PRs without response for weeks

---

## Getting Help

### Communication Channels

- **GitHub Issues**: For bugs and feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions**: For questions and general discussion
- **Pull Request Comments**: For questions about specific changes

### Questions About Contributing

If you're unsure about:
- How to implement a feature
- Whether a change would be accepted
- How to test something
- How to structure your code
- Anything else related to contributing

Please open a [discussion](https://github.com/Mjoyufull/fsel/discussions) or comment on a related issue. The maintainers are happy to help guide you.

### Common Questions

**Q: I found a typo in the documentation. Do I still need to open a PR?**  
A: Yes, but it's a very quick process. Create a `docs/fix-typo` branch, make the change, push, and open a PR. Documentation improvements are always welcome.

**Q: My PR hasn't been reviewed yet. Should I ping someone?**  
A: Wait 2-4 days for initial response. If no response after 5 days, feel free to leave a polite comment on the PR.

**Q: Can I work on multiple features at once?**  
A: Yes, but create separate branches and PRs for each feature. This makes review easier and allows features to be merged independently.

**Q: I want to refactor a large part of the codebase. Should I do it?**  
A: Open an issue first to discuss the refactoring plan. Large refactors need coordination to avoid conflicts with ongoing work.

**Q: The maintainer wants to merge my PR internally. Did I do something wrong?**  
A: No! This means your contribution is good, but it needs integration with ongoing refactoring work or feature changes. You'll be credited in the release notes.
