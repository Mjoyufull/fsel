# Keybind Configuration for fsel
# Customize all keyboard shortcuts here or in your main config.toml
# Changes take effect immediately on next launch

# ===== NAVIGATION =====

# Move down in list (also: Ctrl+N for vim-style navigation)
down = ["down", { key = "n", modifiers = "ctrl" }]

# Move up in list (also: Ctrl+P for vim-style navigation)
up = ["up", { key = "p", modifiers = "ctrl" }]

# Jump to first item in list
left = ["left"]

# Jump to last item in list
right = ["right"]

# ===== ACTIONS =====

# Launch selected app or select item (also: Ctrl+Y)
select = ["enter", { key = "y", modifiers = "ctrl" }]

# Exit without launching (also: Ctrl+Q, Ctrl+C)
exit = ["esc", { key = "q", modifiers = "ctrl" }, { key = "c", modifiers = "ctrl" }]

# Toggle pin/favorite on selected app (pinned apps always appear first with ðŸ“Œ icon)
pin = [{ key = "space", modifiers = "ctrl" }]

# Delete character from search query
backspace = ["backspace"]

# ===== CCLIP MODE ONLY =====
# These keybinds only work in clipboard history mode (fsel --cclip)

# Display large fullscreen image preview (bypasses TUI, press any key to return)
# Note: Ctrl+I is the same as Tab in terminals, so we use Alt+I instead
image_preview = [{ key = "i", modifiers = "alt" }]

# Tag clipboard item with custom tags (colors, emojis)
# Note: Press Esc to cancel tag creation/editing
tag = [{ key = "t", modifiers = "ctrl" }]

# Remove tag from clipboard item (hardcoded, not configurable)
# Keybind: Alt+T
# Note: This prompts which tag to remove if item has multiple tags
